## Overview

Imagine that you were able to replicate the efficiency of uploading a big collection of NFTs with its corresponding metadata to a marketplace like <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>, just like <a href ="https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub">The Bored Ape Yacht Club</a> and <a href ="https://opensea.io/collection/cryptopunks">Cryptopunks</a> have done in the past.

**You would be saving a lot of time and avoiding headaches if that were possible!** üòé
  
  ><em><h4>Interesting, but I've heard that it requires to know a lot about Smart Contracts, Solidity and other geek stuff to do so...ü§î</h4></em> 
  
Fortunately that's not exactly the case ***IF you have created a collection of NFTs using*** <a href ="https://github.com/noahverner1995/SAND-wich">***SAND-wich***</a> ü•™üòâ.

<a href ="https://github.com/noahverner1995/SAND-wich">***SAND-wich***</a> is another open-source project that is useful for making simple NFT collections that require merging any number of 2d layers following an specific order (provided by you), as well as the corresponding metadata used in the process. 

Once you have created your NFT collection with **SAND-wich**, and also read this guide, you will be ready for starting <a href ="https://github.com/noahverner1995/Bulkdozer/blob/main/exe/bulkdozer.exe">***The Bulkdozer***</a> üöõ.
  
  ><em><h3>That's cool, what do I need to know? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h3></em> 

I'm glad you ask!
  
Essentially you must know that after having logged in to your OpenSea account, and created the corresponding NFT collection in which you desire to upload your NFTs, you will start **The Bulkdozer**, which will ask you for some inputs, for then taking limited control of your Chrome Browser for doing an automated process, until it completely finishes uploading your NFTs (including the metadata).

**There are several conditions you need to meet and maintain if you want this program to run as good as expected**, these ones will be shown further below in this guide.
  
By now, let's start mentioning a summary of the technology this program uses ü§ñ:

  - **Technology stack**: Python 3.9.6 [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)], Pandas 1.3.1, Selenium 4.1.0, NumPy 1.21.1, PyAutoGUI 0.9.53.
  - **Status**:  0.1.0
  - **Executable**: https://github.com/noahverner1995/Bulkdozer/blob/main/exe/bulkdozer.exe
  - **What makes this software different from others?** The ease of use, the brand concept behind it, and the added value it provides to the collections created with **SAND-wich**.

## Installation

**If you are a developer**, you will first have to have installed `Python 3.9.6` or later with the following dependencies: `Pandas 1.3.1` or later, `Selenium 4.1.0` or later, `NumPy 1.21.1` or later, `PyAutoGUI 0.9.53` or later. Then you can copy the code from the `bulkdozer.py` file and run it in your preferred environment.
    
**If you ARE NOT a developer**, you will first have to deactivate your Antivirus for then <a href ="https://github.com/noahverner1995/Bulkdozer/blob/main/exe/bulkdozer.exe">downloading the exe file</a>. Then you can execute the program by clicking on it and pressing ‚ÜµEnter.
